This app intentionally defines no database models.
All data models now live in the `core` app to avoid duplication.

If you need to reference models here (for typing or utilities), import from core:
    from core.models import (
        MentorProfile, MentorshipRequest, SavingsGroup, SavingsMember, Transaction,
        Product, Cart, CartItem, Order, User
    )

# No model classes here on purpose.
